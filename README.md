🏦 Bank Analytics Dashboard

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing banking loan and customer data to uncover meaningful insights that can support better financial decision-making. The analysis was done as part of my internship at ExcelR Solutions.

The dataset contains 39,717 customer records, including details about loan amounts, grades, verification status, payment history, and home ownership. The goal was to visualize trends, assess risk, and identify opportunities for improved credit management.

- Compare verified vs non-verified customer payments.
- Examine grade and sub-grade revolving balances for risk assessment.
- Study state-wise and month-wise loan status.
- Explore the relationship between home ownership and last payment dates.


🧠 Key Insights

- Total loan amounts showed consistent year-on-year growth, with 2011 having the highest disbursement.
